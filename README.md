Basic discord bot made with python, for free music downloading.
For educational purposes only!

RIGHT NOW ONLY WORKS WITH CHROME 135.x.x.x, TO CHECK:
GO to the 3 dots on the top right > Help > About Google Chrome


YOU NEED TO USE CHROME, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS AROUND WITH THE SETTINGS. I used the undetected_chromedriver to bypass cloudflare
THIS ALSO USES PYTHON, SO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THAT INSTALLED AND READY

WARNING!!!
UNDETECTED_CHROMEDRIVER DOES NOT HIDE YOUR IP ADDRESS, SO YOU MIGHT NEED TO USE VPN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET FLAGGED.


In the terminal:
git clone https://github.com/endtrastic/spotbot/



THEN LOCATE THE PATH AND OPEN IT IN VS CODE OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO USE!


On the main path in the terminal run:
pip install -r requirements.txt


AFTER THAT!



Fill out the .env file,

MAKE SURE TO SAVE THE FILE WITH THE INFO YOU ENTERED: CTRL + S for WINDOWS.


TO RUN THE BOT, MAKE SURE IN THE TERMINAL, YOUR PATH ENDS WITH: bot/ 

To get there, on the main path enter: cd bot 
To go back: cd .. if you fucked up

ONCE ON bot/
enter: python bots.py
